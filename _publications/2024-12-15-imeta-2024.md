excerpt: 'The iMeta Conference 2024 provides a platform to promote the development of an innovative scientific research ecosystem for microbiome and One Health. The four key components - Technology, Research (Biology), Academic journals, and Social media - form a synergistic ecosystem. Advanced technologies drive biological research, which generates novel insights that are disseminated through academic journals. Social media plays a crucial role in engaging the public and facilitating scientific communication, thus amplifying the impact of research. Together, these elements create a self-sustaining loop that fosters continuous innovation and collaboration in the field of bioinformatics, biotechnology and microbiome research.'

The iMeta Conference 2024 provides a platform to promote the development of an innovative scientific research ecosystem for microbiome and One Health. The four key components - Technology, Research (Biology), Academic journals, and Social media - form a synergistic ecosystem. Advanced technologies drive biological research, which generates novel insights that are disseminated through academic journals. Social media plays a crucial role in engaging the public and facilitating scientific communication, thus amplifying the impact of research. Together, these elements create a self-sustaining loop that fosters continuous innovation and collaboration in the field of bioinformatics, biotechnology and microbiome research.
