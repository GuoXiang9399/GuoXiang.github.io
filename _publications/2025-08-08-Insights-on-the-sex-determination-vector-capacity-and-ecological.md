Background: Mosquitoes with aggressive biting behavior are important disease vectors threatening public health. Armigeres subalbatus, as an emerging arbovirus and filarial disease vector, exhibits aggressive host-seeking behavior and unique breeding preference for contaminated water. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these biological characteristics remain poorly understood. This study aimed to generate a high-quality genome assembly and characterize the genetic basis of vector competence and environmental adaptation in Ar. subalbatus. Methods: We sequenced and assembled the Ar. subalbatus genome using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing, Illumina short-read sequencing, and Hi-C technology. Comparative genomic analysis was performed to identify gene families related to detoxification, diapause, innate immunity, and sex determination. Gene structure analysis focused on the male-determining factor and its evolutionary relationships with other mosquito vectors. Results: The genome assembly consists of three chromosomes, with a total size of 1.33 Gbp and an N50 of 430.15 Mbp (GenBank assembly: GCA_024139115.2), displaying 99.4% Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) completeness. We identified the gene structure of the male-determining factor (AsuMf) and characterized its evolutionary relationship with other mosquito vectors. The analysis revealed expanded detoxification-related gene families including cytochrome P450s, which may facilitate adaptation to contaminated breeding sites. We characterized 566 putative diapause-related genes that could potentially contribute to geographical expansion, 334 innate immune genes, and 1673 endogenous viral elements, indicating complex virus-host interactions throughout evolution. Conclusions: Our study provides insights into the molecular basis of vector competence and adaptation in Ar. subalbatus. The expanded detoxification gene families may enable the species to survive in polluted environments, while the identified diapause-related genes could explain its geographical expansion capabilities. These findings establish a foundation for developing novel vector control strategies targeting this emerging disease vector.
